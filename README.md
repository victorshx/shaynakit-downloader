# intro
a simple scraper to download almost all Figma design files from [ShaynaKit](https://shaynakit.com/landing), including paid contents ;)

some files will be missed (0KB) because sometimes the download url has a different format.

future releases will propose a way to resolve the issue above

# getting started

## install
```
git clone https://github.com/victorshx/shaynakit-downloader
yarn
```

## run
```
yarn start
```
Voila! Wait for it to download more than 180+ Figma files 😍

`
Check your current directory > ./downloads for the downloaded contents
